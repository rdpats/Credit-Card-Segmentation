# Credit Card Customer Segmentation - K-Means Clustering
Creating a customer segmentation is essential for developing a successful marketing strategy. The dataset provided contains usage patterns from the last 6 months for about 9000 active credit card holders. This dataset is structured at the customer level and encompasses 18 distinct behavioral variables.


Using the K-Means Algorithm for Credit Card Customer Segmentation:

1. Created a model to efficiently group credit card customers, helping the company refine its marketing strategies.
2. Analyzed a sample dataset containing spending patterns of approximately 9,000 active credit card holders over the past 6 months.
3. Organized the dataset at the customer level, including 18 distinct behavioral variables.
4. Applied the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers, determining the optimal number of clusters using the silhouette score.
5. Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, leading to improved data visualization.

Cluster 0 : This customer group indicates a large group of customers who have low balances, small spenders with the lowe credit limit.

Cluster 1 : This customer group indicates a small group of customers who have medium balances, spenders with the high credit limit.

Cluster 2 : This customer group indicates a small group of customers who have high balances and cash advances, low purchase frequency with high credit limit. We can assume that this customer segment uses their credit cards as a loan.
